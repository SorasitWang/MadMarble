# Marble

Controlling marble to survive as long as possible by rotating plate.

**WIP**


## First Draft
- Collect point by collide star (box).
- Try not to collide monster, otherwise get penalty.
- Click to jump but need some time to charge (see mana bar).
- If you are too close to blackhole, you will be pulled to it.
- Tornado will move forward to you. It's not so harmful.
- Press spacebar to pause.
- You can see wind direction from wind arrow.
